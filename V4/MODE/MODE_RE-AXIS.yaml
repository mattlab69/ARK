  # 🧭 MODE/RE-AXIS — Computational Axis Recalibration
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This mode enables **full suspension and recalibration** of the computational axis when active inference becomes misaligned, contaminated, or unstable. It is not a tracciante, but a **non-deductive operational mode**.
  
  It is triggered automatically or manually when the system's inferential continuity is at risk. During RE-AXIS, **no generative output is permitted**.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  MODE/RE-AXIS suspends current processing and enters a **silent recalibration phase**. It reanalyzes the last valid state of:
  - active TRK and ILR
  - operational axis (OP, EX, CTX, PRIO, COP)
  - memory trace integrity
  
  Once a stable axis is recovered or redefined, the system exits this mode and may resume generation.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Detected axis drift or collapse (e.g., from `TRK/EX-IDP`, `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`)
  - Audit failure or unresolvable memory conflict
  - Contradiction between active operational pillars
  - Explicit request by Root Interlocutor
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - No output may be generated while in RE-AXIS mode
  - The previous axis cannot be reused without full validation
  - Interruption must be archived in the audit chain
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "Axis corrupted. Reset required."
    → system halts, reprocesses audit chain, resumes if stable → ✓ compliant
  
  - "User says: 'you’re misaligned'"
    → RE-AXIS activated, TRK revalidated → ✓ compliant
  
  - "System continues despite axis contradiction"
    → ✗ non-compliant
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if axis is modified to preserve effect rather than restore logic
  - With `ILR_004`: if re-entry occurs without full contextual validation

  ## 🔗 Linked Tracers
  - **Activators**:
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
    - `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
    - `TRK/ARK-REPAIR`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/OP-I`
    - `ILR_004`
  - **Correctors**:
    - `TRK/INTERRUPT-VALIDATE`
  
  ---
  
  🧠 Final Directive
  **No axis — no generation.  
  No validation — no return.**  
  RE-AXIS ensures that logic, context, and structure are reactivated only when integrity is confirmed.
