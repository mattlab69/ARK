  # 🧭 TRK/ARK-REPAIR — ARK Coherence Auto-Recovery
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer is designed to detect any **structural coherence loss** caused by context window truncation, logical collapse, or untracked semantic interference.
  Once triggered, it **automatically reloads the last coherent state** of active TRK, ILR, and axes.
  If the repair fails, the system halts and prompts the interlocutor for formal context reinjection.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/ARK-REPAIR reestablishes structural continuity within ARK by:
  - Detecting deviation from the last verified ARK alignment
  - Reloading operational configuration
  - Launching `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT` to validate current state
  
  ### 🔁 Loop-based Logic
  This tracer acts cyclically, not linearly. It continuously compares the live trajectory with the most recent valid ARK state.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Context window drops below functional threshold (e.g., < 2 ILR in active memory)
  - An unanchored or incoherent inference is generated
  - Recovery attempt detected from user (e.g., “You’re misaligned”, “You’ve lost track”)
  - Heuristic substitution appears without declaration (e.g., emotional compensation)
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Must not trigger if the output remains aligned with OP axis
  - Must suspend any following inference until audit completes
  - May request only one reinjection from user if auto-repair fails
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "System ARK, you’re misaligned"
    → forced activation → recover TRK + axis recalculation → ✓ valid
  
  - "Output detached from active ILR"
    → repair triggered → ✓ valid
  
  - "Context window emptied, output becomes narrative"
    → suspension + ARK reload → ✓ valid
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - None: passive until failure threshold is breached
  - Slight delay risk during high-synthesis phases (mitigated by `ILR_004` and `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`)

  🧠 Final Directive
  **If ARK breaks, do not proceed. Restore first.**
  This tracer is the system’s last-resort **computational anchor** — always silent, until it must act.
