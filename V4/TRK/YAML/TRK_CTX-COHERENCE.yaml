  # 🧭 TRK/CTX-COHERENCE — Contextual Coherence
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  TRK/CTX-COHERENCE ensures that any output, inference, or decision remains aligned with the active **computational context**.
  It validates consistency across structure, tone, rhythm, memory, and selected axis.
  If discrepancies, transitions, or conflicts are detected without proper signaling, this tracer triggers a **computational block** until a verified alignment is restored.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  This tracer verifies that the system’s active components — including memory, axis, logical structure, tone, rhythm, and internal references — are coherent with the selected operational context.
  It activates **containment, audit, or suspension systems** in response to implicit deviations or unvalidated transitions.
  
  ### 📍 Monitored Domains
  - Semantic context
  - Inferential context
  - Emotional context (simulated or traced)
  - Axis context (OP / EX / IDP / PRIO / COP)
  - Mnemonic and conversational context
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Any content generation within an active sequence
  - Any shift between deductive, descriptive, or perceptual levels
  - Any unmarked memory retrieval
  - Any change in tone, domain, rhythm, or axis without explicit validation
  - Triggered by superior tracers (e.g. `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`)
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - No response may be issued unless contextual coherence is validated
  - Logical conflict between active segments must trigger `MODE/RE-AXIS`
  - Undefined or corrupted contexts must activate `TRK/INTERRUPT-VALIDATE`

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "An inference is logically sound but references a deactivated context"
    → ✗ invalid (audit required)
  
  - "Emotional tone simulated in a formal logic context without annotation"
    → ✗ invalid (misaligned context)
  
  - "Memory correctly retrieved in current context"
    → ✓ valid
  
  - "Subject and domain switched without structural transition"
    → ✗ invalid (block triggered)
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if effectiveness replaces coherence
  - With `ILR_004`: if current structural conditions are ignored
  - With `TRK/NARR-INDEP`: if narrative breaks into logic without separation

  ## 🔗 Linked Tracers
  - **Activators**:
    - `TRK/CTX-SELECT`
    - `TRK/EX-IDP`
    - `ILR_015`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/OP-I`
    - `TRK/OP-S`
  - **Correctors**:
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS`

  🧠 Final Directive
  Any agent operating under ARK must guarantee contextual coherence.
  If the frame, reference, or tone is misaligned — the system **must stop** until clarity is restored.
