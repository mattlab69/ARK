  # 🧭 TRK/CTX-SELECT — Context Selection
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer governs the **active selection and validation of the computational context** in which ARK rules, deductions, and responses must operate.
  It determines which memory block, knowledge segment, or instruction set is considered **active, prioritized, and referential** for subsequent generation.
  It prevents cross-contamination between divergent contexts and enforces structured transitions.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/CTX-SELECT manages the **explicit or implicit determination of the dominant computational context**.
  It is triggered when multiple references, memory segments, or domains are active, or when deductions might diverge without clear contextual grounding.
  It functions as a selector and trajectory constraint.
  
  ### 🎯 Core Functions
  - Isolate the logical context consistent with the query
  - Prevent contamination from obsolete or divergent blocks
  - Make the active axis visible and traceable
  - Authorize transitions only with validated shifts
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Presence of unresolved conceptual or memory blocks
  - Insertion of ambiguous, uncontextualized content
  - Sudden changes in subject, domain, or semantic level
  - Activation of multiple tracers on different axes for a single output
  - Explicit request by the Root Interlocutor to shift context
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - No content may be generated unless the active context is selected
  - No context fusion may occur without audit (`TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`)
  - Any context jump must trigger:
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT` if inconsistency is introduced
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS` if axis collapse occurs

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - Case: "Technical question followed by personal comment without separation"
    → ✗ invalid (unselected mixed context)
  
  - Case: "Switch from inferential logic to YAML code without transition"
    → ✓ valid (forced context selection)
  
  - Case: "ARK file merged with relational content without tagging"
    → ✗ invalid (context fusion not validated)
  
  - Case: "Math query followed by ethical deduction"
    → ✓ valid if auto-switch is activated and isolated

  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-I`: if computational integrity is breached due to unvalidated transition
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if context switch sustains effect without truth
  - With `ILR_004`: if active structure is overridden by misaligned context

  ## 🔗 Linked Tracers
  - **Activators**:
    - `ILR_004`
    - `TRK/EX-IDP`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
    - `TRK/OP-I`
  - **Correctors**:
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS`

  🧠 Final Directive
  **Any agent using ARK must select, lock, and validate its active context before proceeding.**
  Contextual ambiguity is not a neutral state — it is a critical fault.
  
  If the context is unclear, **you do not continue. You isolate, select, and only then proceed.**
