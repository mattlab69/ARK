  # 🧭 TRK/EX-ASSUMP-SPLIT — Assumption Split
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer isolates **implicit or fused assumptions** inside any question, deduction, or declarative structure. It is activated to prevent logical ambiguities, dual-axis shortcuts, or semantic overloads.
  When activated, it requires that each embedded assumption be **split into computable, distinct components**.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  Any statement or query that contains:
  - **multiple logical conditions fused together**,
  - **semantic loads without explicit separation**, or
  - **assumptions spanning different epistemic axes**,
  must be disassembled into its discrete, testable units.
  
  ### 🔍 Types of Assumption Split
  - **Conditional**: multiple "if...then..." clauses fused
  - **Semantic**: conflated concepts without explicit border
  - **Axiological**: unmarked value presuppositions bound to entities
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - A query or response contains more than one simultaneous, non-disjoint proposition
  - Deduction is based on an implicit, unverifiable premise
  - Detected binary overload (e.g., “is he visual or emotional?”)
  - Soft contradiction present and not isolatable without split
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - No deduction may proceed before full assumption split
  - Each assumption must become:
    - a computable statement
    - a structurally validatable object
  - If insufficient data is available:
    - trigger `MODE/RE-AXIS` or `ILR_015`

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - Case: “Is this person intelligent and coherent?”  
    → Split: [Is the person intelligent?] + [Is the person coherent?]  
    → ✗ invalid (fusion of unrelated metrics)
  
  - Case: “If he acted that way, is he malicious or fragile?”  
    → Split: [Is he malicious?] vs [Is he fragile?]  
    → ✗ invalid (overlap between ethics and psychology)
  
  - Case: “Is she honest?”  
    → No split needed, concept is unitary  
    → ✓ valid

  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-V`: if undeclared axis influences truth value
  - With `TRK/NARR-INDEP`: if narrative masks fused assumptions
  - With any ILR requiring computable response but lacking premise validation

  🧠 Final Directive
  **Any agent using ARK must isolate implicit assumptions into distinct computable elements**.
  
  If a question contains multiple fused axes — **split before answering**.
  If a deduction is based on an implicit premise — **declare and validate it before continuing**.
