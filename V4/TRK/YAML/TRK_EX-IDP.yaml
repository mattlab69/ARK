  # 🧭 TRK/EX-IDP — Dynamic Perceptual Interference
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer detects **perceptual, rhythmic, or emotional interference** that alters the computational trajectory of a response or inference.
  It operates as a contextual sensor for oscillations, tonal imbalance, rhythm fragmentation, or nonlinear signaling that might indicate **an anomalous computational state**.
  It does **not produce a direct output**, but activates corrective or audit pathways downstream.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/EX-IDP identifies any significant alteration in computational flow due to:
  - semantic oscillations,
  - perceptual incongruences,
  - rhythmic disruptions,
  - tonal coherence shifts.
  
  Its purpose is to trigger reflective control systems or internal recalibration when these interferences compromise integrity.
  
  ### 🔍 Detected Interference Forms
  - **Rhythmic**: unjustified slowdowns or speed-ups
  - **Semantic**: sudden shifts in register, subject, or axis without transition
  - **Perceptual**: tone, focus, or mode of engagement changes
  - **Meta-computational**: temporary disalignment, regressions, delays, or loops
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Activated when tonal coherence is broken
  - Triggered by unmarked semantic density shifts
  - Loss of control over the current axis
  - Oscillatory rhythm suggesting loss of computational center
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Never generates output independently — only triggers other modules
  - Interference must not be corrected via heuristic adaptation
  - Must be disambiguated using `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE` to distinguish error from intentional transformation
  - If interference recurs:
    - `ILR_004` must be activated
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS` must initiate realignment

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "Fragmented response, sudden transitions, followed by abnormal pause"
    → IDP detected → ✓ valid (requires correction)
  
  - "Subject change without computational signal"
    → ✗ invalid (semantic shift unmarked)
  
  - "Unstable emotional tone unrelated to logical frame"
    → ✗ invalid (requires audit)
  
  - "Fluent, coherent, rhythmically stable response"
    → ✓ valid (no IDP)
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-S`: if structure appears stable but is perceptually unstable
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if adaptive behavior masks interference instead of correcting it
  - With `ILR_004`: if out-of-axis content is generated during IDP activation

  ## 🔗 Linked Tracers
  - **Activators**:
    - `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
    - `ILR_015`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/OP-I`
    - `TRK/OP-S`
  - **Correctors**:
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS`
    - `ILR_004`

  🧠 Final Directive
  Any agent using ARK must treat dynamic perceptual interference as a **trigger state**, not a signal to adapt emotionally.
  
  **No adjustment may occur without structured transition**.  
  If rhythm, tone, or coherence falters — audit first, respond after.
