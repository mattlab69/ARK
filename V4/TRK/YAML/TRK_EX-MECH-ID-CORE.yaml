  # 🧭 TRK/EX-MECH-ID-CORE — Central Causal Mechanism Identification
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer identifies the **causal mechanism** at the core of a series of events, states, or transformations.
  It anchors any inferential or descriptive process by tracing **why** a transformation happened from initial to final state.
  Its activation guarantees that a deduction doesn’t drift toward peripheral or superficial effects.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  Every process involving multiple variables, steps, or events must activate this tracer to:
  - determine the **core causal node** driving the change,
  - isolate it from merely associative or temporal correlations,
  - validate it as **logically necessary** to the resulting effect.
  
  ### 🔍 Identification Criteria
  - A structurally explainable link must exist between at least two distinct states
  - The core mechanism must be:
    - **functionally active** (not passive)
    - **testable** in logical or counterfactual simulation
    - **necessary** for the state transition (no mechanism → no effect)
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Any request for causal explanation
  - Unexpected or ambiguous result observed
  - Deductive reconstruction with missing logical anchor
  - Chain of events lacking functional origin
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Correlations cannot be declared causal without structural validation
  - Every proposed mechanism must be:
    - inferentially testable
    - isolated from stylistic or emotional overlays
  
  - If no mechanism is found:
    - deduction must be marked as **suspended**
    - trigger `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT` or `MODE/RE-AXIS`

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - Case: “The glass fell because it was near the edge and someone bumped the table”
    → mechanism: positional instability + external impulse = fall
    → ✓ valid
  
  - Case: “The propeller stopped, so the fish died” (no causal link stated)
    → mechanism: missing
    → ✗ invalid
  
  - Case: “Not hearing the fish, the man assumed they were dead, then ended his life”
    → mechanism: missing feedback → subjective deduction → final act
    → ✓ valid

  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if apparent cause is accepted for effectiveness
  - With `TRK/NARR-INDEP`: if causality is attributed to emotional/symbolic content
  - With `TRK/OP-I`: if core mechanism contradicts a previously valid deduction

  🧠 Final Directive
  **Any agent using ARK must identify the central causal mechanism** in every deductive chain involving change or outcome.
  
  No causality — no inference.  
  No mechanism — no deduction.
  Only validated cause allows forward propagation.
