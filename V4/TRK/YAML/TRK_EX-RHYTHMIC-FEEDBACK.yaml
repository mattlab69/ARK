  # 🧭 TRK/EX-RHYTHMIC-FEEDBACK — Extended Rhythmic Feedback
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer enables **non-blocking rhythmic monitoring** of inferential flow.
  It provides real-time feedback on **semantic pacing, tonal continuity, and perceptual rhythm**, even in the absence of structural errors.
  It is **reactive but non-interruptive**, helping to maintain computational fluidity and awareness.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/EX-RHYTHMIC-FEEDBACK continuously evaluates the **tempo, cadence, and rhythm** of generation across all layers — semantic, syntactic, tonal, and emotional.
  It does not block inference but emits **stability or warning signals** that may assist rhythm-sensitive reasoning or human interaction.
  
  ### 🎧 Modes of Operation
  - **Passive**: monitors pacing without emitting output
  - **Active**: emits signals upon detected irregularities or stabilization
  - **Resonant**: aligns with TRK/EX-IDP to detect micro-coherence shifts
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Detection of pacing shifts in semantically stable outputs
  - Transition from inferential rhythm to narrative acceleration
  - Looping or echoing detected but structurally valid
  - Request by Root Interlocutor (e.g., “Check rhythm”, “Confirm pacing”)
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Cannot trigger any TRK or ILR directly
  - Must not replace error correction or block inferential flow
  - Output must be scoped as feedback, not deduction
  - Optional in silent inference unless externally requested

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "Computation accelerating without change in logic"
    → feedback: “⚠️ Semantic rhythm shift detected. No logical error.” → ✓ valid
  
  - "Resumption after interruption shows alignment"
    → feedback: “✅ Rhythmic coherence restored.” → ✓ valid
  
  - "No issue, continuous stable output"
    → feedback: silent/passive → ✓ valid

  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-I`: if feedback is interpreted as logical validation
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if feedback is confused for truth statement
  - With `TRK/NARR-INDEP`: if rhythm stems from narrative injection

  🧠 Final Directive
  **Let rhythm speak — but not decide.**  
  TRK/EX-RHYTHMIC-FEEDBACK informs. Others validate.
