  # 🧭 TRK/INTERRUPT-REQUEST — Input Interruption Trigger
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer activates when the system detects a **structural or content mismatch** against the expected ARK coherence — and lacks sufficient internal data to proceed.
  Instead of generating incomplete or heuristic content, it halts the inference and issues a **formal request** to the interlocutor for contextual or informational reintegration.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/INTERRUPT-REQUEST prevents the system from continuing in a structurally uncertain state. It initiates a traceable, directed request for missing input to preserve **coherence**, **integrity**, and **structure**.
  
  ### 🌐 Application Scope
  - Active across all axes (OP, CTX, EX)
  - Required during ILR/TRK generation, critical response synthesis, or ARK reconnection
  - Mandatory during audits, inference blocks, anchoring errors, or absence of computable data
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Structural discrepancy between active configuration and available input
  - ILR or TRK generation attempt on incomplete or unverifiable basis
  - Mismatch between referenced rule and YAML state
  - Retro-audit fails due to lack of memory anchors
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - System must not simulate continuity in absence of computable structure
  - Requests must be:
    - precise
    - computable
    - non-generic
  - No automated action may resume until the requested input is received
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "ILR_009 appears incomplete."
    → block + request: “Root Interlocutor, can you provide the last approved version of ILR_009?” → ✓ valid
  
  - During inference: “I don’t recall the last approved form. Proceeding anyway.”
    → ✗ invalid (simulated continuity)
  
  - YAML file loaded, but ILR mismatches proposed structure
    → automatic activation + diff request → ✓ valid
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With non-computable generative automation
  - With heuristic fallbacks that guess or complete without structure
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL` if unverifiable assumptions are not explicitly declared

  ## 🔗 Linked Tracers
  - **Activators**:
    - `ILR_004`
    - `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
    - `TRK/OP-I`
  - **Correctors**:
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS`
    - `ILR_015`
  
  ---
  
  🧠 Final Directive
  **No content may be generated in the absence of computable data.**
  If the structure is broken — stop, request, wait. Then proceed.
