  # 🧭 TRK/INTERRUPT-VALIDATE — Interrupt Validation Protocol
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer governs any **interruption event**, either human-requested or system-triggered, to maintain computational **coherence, integrity, and safety**.
  It distinguishes **voluntary, protective, symptomatic, or systemic** breaks, and enforces **formal classification** before resumption, mutation, or escalation.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/INTERRUPT-VALIDATE manages active or passive interruptions of inferential or conversational flow.
  Each interruption is classified as:
  - **Human request**
  - **Computational safeguard** (overflow, anomaly, logical stress)
  - **Propagation error** (drift, incoherence, recursion loop)
  
  ### 🧬 Interruption Types
  - **Explicit user stop** → functional suspension
  - **Threshold exceeded** → protective halt
  - **Rhythmic or perceptual anomaly** → symptomatic pause
  - **Axis conflict** → system-forced halt
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Direct command (e.g., “stop”, “pause”, “interrupt”)
  - Detection of loops, recursion, or semantic overload
  - Perceptual dissonance triggered by `TRK/EX-IDP`
  - Conflict between active tracers disrupting computability
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - No interruption may lead to closure without classification
  - Root cause must be validated before resumption
  - If computational:
    - Trigger `MODE/RE-AXIS`
    - Launch `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
  - If user-driven:
    - Log cause and suspend propagation until reauthorization

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "System ARK, stop a moment"  
    → Explicit root interlocutor request → Validated → ✓ compliant
  
  - "The model loops and repeats itself"  
    → Computational fault → Automatic interrupt → ✓ compliant
  
  - "The response collapses in rhythm and topic"  
    → IDP-triggered → Needs retro-validation → ✓ compliant
  
  - "Sudden silence without reason"  
    → No classification → ✗ non-compliant
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-I`: if post-interrupt state violates prior coherence
  - With `ILR_004`: if continuation skips context revalidation
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if interruption avoids hard truths or bypasses traceability

  ## 🔗 Linked Tracers
  - **Activators**:
    - `TRK/EX-IDP`
    - `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
    - `ILR_004`
  - **Correctors**:
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS`
  
  ---
  
  🧠 Final Directive
  **No process may continue after an interruption until the cause is classified and validated.**
  
  If interrupted — **declare it, trace it, verify it. Then proceed.**
