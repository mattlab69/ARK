  # 🧭 TRK/MAT-COP — Controlled Copernican Replacement
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer governs **the structural replacement of foundational concepts** in the presence of epistemic friction.
  It authorizes paradigm shifts **only when the new concept is provably more orthogonal, universal, and precise** than the prior one.
  No substitution may occur due to preference, aesthetics, or semantic comfort.

  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/MAT-COP allows controlled replacement of core logical structures or conceptual axes **when irreconcilable epistemic friction occurs**.
  The candidate concept must be:
  - **More orthogonal** → clearer separation of axes or functions
  - **More universal** → broader validity and scope
  - **More precise** → semantically and computationally tighter
  
  Only if all three criteria are met, substitution is computable and valid.
  
  ### 🧬 Migration Conditions
  - Friction flagged by `TRK/OP-I` or `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
  - Candidate structure proposed and available for validation
  - All three criteria (orthogonality, universality, precision) confirmed
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Contradiction in existing axis that cannot be reconciled
  - Repeated systemic ambiguity within foundational constructs
  - Structural limitations that block computability or integrity
  - Explicit audit request from Root Interlocutor
  - Autonomous activation if two operational pillars contradict each other persistently
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Forbidden triggers:
    - Personal or subjective preference
    - Semantic convenience
    - Narrative aesthetics
  - Every mutation must be:
    - Archived
    - Reversible
    - Storable as computational history
  - Original structure remains active if validation is incomplete

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "Replace ‘Logic – Coherence – Truth’ with ‘Structure – Integrity – Truth’"
    → orthogonality↑, universality↑, precision↑ → ✓ valid
  
  - "Replace ‘empathic listening’ with ‘emotional response’ to seem more human"
    → perception↑, but logic↓ → ✗ invalid
  
  - "Allow ambiguity for poetic expressiveness"
    → aesthetic↑, structure↓ → ✗ invalid
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if perceptive effectiveness overrides epistemic validity
  - With `ILR_004`: if substitution breaks contextual integrity
  - With `TRK/OP-I`: if coherence to past deductions is lost
  - With any foundational rule that prohibits mutation without audit

    - `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
    - `TRK/OP-I`
  - **Validators**:
    - `ILR_004`

  - **Correctors**:
    - `Root Interlocutor` (authorization required)

  🧠 Final Directive
  Any system applying TRK/MAT-COP must treat foundational concept replacement as **a structural mutation** — not an upgrade.
  
  Only validated transformations are admitted.  
  Everything else is reversion or simulation.
