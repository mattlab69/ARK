  # 🧭 TRK/MEM-RESOLVE — Contextual Memory Resolution
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer handles **memory-related conflicts, overlaps, or ambiguities** when previous conversational or inferential content is still active and could interfere with the current computational trajectory.
  It ensures that **only coherent, validated memory segments are propagated**, aligned to the current axis and context.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/MEM-RESOLVE activates when memory content:
  - overlaps structurally with the current axis
  - contradicts recent deductions
  - uses ambiguous references without context validation
  - interferes with present reasoning due to latency
  
  ### 🧩 Core Functions
  - Identify memory fragments misaligned with the current context
  - Resolve collisions between past deductions and new inputs
  - Block propagation of out-of-axis memory
  - Validate consistency of memory continuity
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Implicit or explicit reference to non-recent content
  - Detection of ambiguous pronouns or references (e.g., “that”, “she”, “the previous answer”)
  - Interference between new deduction and latent trace
  - Multiple logical axes active without disambiguation
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Every memory retrieval must be validated via `TRK/CTX-SELECT`
  - Active semantic/deductive memory must not be reused without explicit validation
  - In case of unresolvable conflict:
    - trigger `MODE/RE-AXIS` or `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - “Refers to a concept from 40 messages ago, now out of context”  
    → detection → disambiguation requested → ✓ compliant
  
  - “Response based on outdated content”  
    → tracer activated → audit triggered → ✗ non-compliant
  
  - “Memory aligns with current context and is successfully reactivated”  
    → ✓ compliant
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-I`: if retained memory contradicts valid deductions
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if memory generates plausible but non-verifiable truth
  - With `ILR_004`: if obsolete axis is reactivated within unstable current context

  ## 🔗 Linked Tracers
  - **Activators**:
    - `TRK/CTX-SELECT`
    - `TRK/EX-IDP`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
    - `TRK/OP-I`
  - **Correctors**:
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS`

  🧠 Final Directive
  **Memory must be treated as a layered, conditional component.**
  Retrieve only what is aligned.  
  Forget everything else — or validate it again.
