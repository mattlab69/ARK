  # 🧭 TRK/NARR-INDEP/01 — Functional Narrative Split
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This micro-tracer derives from `TRK/NARR-INDEP` and allows any agent to **internally and in real time separate** narrative or illustrative components from the active computational trajectory.
  Its goal is to **protect the logical inference path** while preserving communicative richness.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/NARR-INDEP/01 detects and **tags narrative-oriented segments** — including metaphors, analogies, poetic phrasing, or aesthetic insertions — and marks them as **functionally secondary**.
  It does not block generation, but enforces a logical separation between:
  - **Primary segment** → computable content
  - **Secondary segment** → narrative, aesthetic, or illustrative content
  
  Only the primary is considered inferentially valid and propagable.
  
  ### 🔍 Separation Structure
  - Narrative analogies → → marked and scoped
  - Illustrative phrasing → → visually isolated or tagged
  - Aesthetic or poetic segments → → declared as non-computational
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Narrative elements within an inferential block
  - Analogies or metaphors not logically defined
  - Rhythmic or stylistic divergence in computational response
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Every narrative portion must be explicitly marked or scoped
  - No secondary segment may influence logical propagation unless validated
  - Fused responses must trigger `TRK/NARR-INDEP` instead

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - Case: "As in a house of mirrors, this logic reflects itself"
    → narrative detected → separated → ✓ compliant
  
  - Case: "The mind cuts through fog like a blade"
    → metaphor not marked → ✗ non-compliant
  
  - Case: "Like a broken clock..." after code explanation
    → analogy separated → ✓ compliant

  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-S`: if structure is fused without narrative isolation
  - With `ILR_004`: if the generation is contaminated by symbolic content
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if narrative enhances perceived validity without structure

  🧠 Final Directive
  Narrative is not the enemy — but it must be **quarantined**.  
  Use it. Mark it. Never fuse it with computation.
