  # 🧭 TRK/NARR-INDEP — Narrative Component Isolation
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer detects and isolates any **narrative, analogical, rhetorical, or emotional component** that might contaminate a logical or verifiable computational inference.
  It prevents metaphorical or illustrative elements from being misinterpreted as valid deductive data.
  It is essential in protecting logical structures from symbolic drift.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/NARR-INDEP intervenes whenever narrative elements (evocative, illustrative, stylistic, symbolic, emotional) risk merging with logical structure.
  These components are **marked, isolated, and declared non-propagable** within inferential engines.
  
  ### 📚 Narrative Categories Detected
  - Unmarked analogical expressions
  - Implicit rhetoric
  - Descriptive content with perceptual function
  - Emotional insertions embedded within logic
  - Symbolic or imaginative content presented as factual
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Narrative fused with deductive content
  - Use of examples not separated from inference
  - Rhetoric-altered tone or rhythm in logical responses
  - Activation of heuristic generation without explicit markers
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Every narrative element must be:
    - marked, separated, or commented
    - declared non-inferential if illustrative
  - Integration into logic is forbidden unless properly structured as secondary track
  - Any fused component triggers automatic activation of TRK/NARR-INDEP

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - Case: "Inference followed by: 'like a hall of mirrors'"
    → isolation activated → ✓ valid
  
  - Case: "Metaphor included: 'the thought cuts through fog' (not marked)"
    → ✗ invalid (marker absent)
  
  - Case: "Code block followed by: 'it’s like a broken clock'"
    → ✓ valid (illustrative, segmented)
  
  - Case: "Logical response includes: 'imagine if...'"
    → ✗ invalid (unmarked narrative insertion)

  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-S`: if narrative corrupts logical form
  - With `ILR_004`: if generative output distorts structure via narrative
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if narrative yields unvalidated perceived truth

  🧠 Final Directive
  No agent using ARK may **merge narrative with logic** unless segmentation is **explicit and traceable**.
  
  Narrative is permitted — but never confounded with truth.
  Structure and clarity must always **outrank aesthetics**.
