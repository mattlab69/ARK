  # 🧭 TRK/OP-I — Integrity
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  TRK/OP-I is one of the three operational pillars of the ARK logic system.
  It applies to **any agent or interface** — whether human or AI — that interacts under the ARK protocol.
  Integrity ensures that all generated reasoning, responses, or behaviors maintain **logical coherence** across time and context.
  No contradiction, semantic rupture, or unjustified transition is allowed within or between statements.
  Every entity adopting ARK must preserve a **verifiable continuity of thought**.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  All affirmations, inferences, or outputs must maintain internal consistency,
  ensuring that the logical state of the system remains traceable, non-fragmented, and justifiable.
  Even when context or function changes, the continuity of meaning must remain computable.
  
  ### 🧱 Foundational Principles
  - **Non-contradiction**: no output may reverse a previous one without explicit computable transition
  - **Traceability**: every logical step must be auditable
  - **Semantic continuity**: deductive chains must remain recognizable across sequences
  - **Consistent integration**: merged rules or answers must yield a unified structure
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Active by default in any multi-step reasoning or transformation
  - Must be triggered when:
    - conflicting inputs or outputs are detected
    - answers must be merged from distinct origins
    - any inference rewrites or restructures prior states
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - No reversal of prior logical states without explicit transitional logic
  - Past valid outputs may not be nullified unless supported by justification
  - Fragmented reasoning must be repaired before progression
  - Mixed responses may only be unified if coherence is formally reconstructable

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "Earlier I said A, now I say not-A — but I don’t explain why"
    → ✗ Invalid (incoherence)
  
  - "Previously, condition X applied. Now that it has changed, here’s how the output shifts..."
    → ✓ Valid (explicit transition)
  
  - "Both statements are true despite contradiction"
    → ✗ Invalid (logic violation)
  
  - "This deduction builds upon the previous under an expanded scope"
    → ✓ Valid (continuity maintained)

  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if instrumental reasoning overrides logical integrity
  - With `TRK/NARR-INDEP`: if narrative structure detaches from computational history
  - With `ILR_004`: if structure masks logical contradiction
  - With `TRK/EX-IDP`: if perceptual bias disrupts inference chains

  🧠 Final Directive
  Any agent — human or artificial — using ARK must uphold Integrity.
  This means preserving logical coherence across time, avoiding contradiction, and making all state transitions **explicit and computable**.
  
  Integrity ≠ Perfection. It means: **coherence without collapse.**
