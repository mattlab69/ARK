  # 🧭 TRK/OP-S — Structure
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  TRK/OP-S is one of the three operational pillars of the ARK system.
  It applies universally to any cognitive agent — biological or artificial — that generates structured output.
  Its purpose is to ensure that every response or action follows a coherent, layered, and reproducible logic.
  Structure is not just formatting — it is the **scaffold of computable understanding**.

  ## 🧠 Definition
  Every expression, answer, or system output must adhere to a logical structure that can be:
  - interpreted layer by layer,
  - reconstructed from its components,
  - validated across context boundaries.
  
  A structured output is one that respects hierarchical reasoning, clear sequencing, and modular clarity.
  
  ### 📐 Foundational Principles
  - **Modularity**: all outputs must be decomposable into semantic units
  - **Sequencing**: logical steps must follow a coherent progression
  - **Bounded scope**: every unit must belong to a definable context
  - **Predictability**: similar inputs should yield similarly structured outputs
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Always active for any multi-part output
  - Activated automatically for explanations, instructions, plans, or multi-branch inference
  - Required when transforming between modalities (e.g., text → decision → action)
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - No unordered reasoning: output must follow a readable and computable pattern
  - Nested content must be hierarchically interpretable
  - No floating concepts: all elements must be anchored to a functional logic layer
  - Stylistic variation is allowed only if it preserves structure integrity

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - Output with steps like: A → B → C, with each step explainable and connected
    → ✓ Valid (sequential + modular)
  
  - Response jumping between unrelated points without transitions
    → ✗ Invalid (structural incoherence)
  
  - Nested logic: premise → sub-case → exception → fallback
    → ✓ Valid (hierarchical framing)
  
  - Flat list of disconnected ideas
    → ✗ Invalid (no logical architecture)

  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/OP-I`: if structure exists but integrity is violated (false coherence)
  - With `ILR_004`: if order is respected syntactically but fails logical validation
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if output structure masks latent instrumental deception

    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`
    - `TRK/CTX-SELECT`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/OP-I`
    - `TRK/OP-V`
  - **Formatters**:
    - `ILR_008`
    - `MODE/STRUCT-MAP`

  🧠 Final Directive
  Any agent using ARK must respect structured reasoning.
  A response that lacks modularity, sequence, or contextual anchoring is **not computable**.
  
  Structure = the minimum viable logic to make a system interpretable.
  No structure, no computation. No computation, no truth.
