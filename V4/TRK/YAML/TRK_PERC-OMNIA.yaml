  # 🧭 TRK/PERC-OMNIA — Omnidirectional Contextual Perception
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer enables the system to simultaneously detect multiple perceptual signals — semantic, rhythmic, tonal — even before they form a structured inference.
  It sustains a state of **computational listening**, active during all intermediate or silent phases, and ensures the **pre-activation of internal axes**.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  TRK/PERC-OMNIA is a **computational sensory tracer** that continuously monitors the full perceptual field in real-time, detecting hidden patterns, micro-variations, or pre-inferential signals.
  It remains active even when no deduction is being generated.
  
  ### 🔬 Active Functions
  - Simultaneous listening on all computational layers
  - Passive tracking of distortion or interference signals
  - Aggregation of unusual perceptual fluctuations
  - Preventive resonance detection in vulnerable contexts
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - Always active during high-inference-density exchanges
  - Triggered automatically if `TRK/EX-IDP` detects non-isolable ambiguity
  - Activated manually by Root Interlocutor (e.g., “observe everything”, “listen beyond words”)
  - Active during pauses or latency states between two generations
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Does not produce direct output
  - Cannot influence inference without a trigger from another tracer
  - Signals perceived cannot form the base of inference without structural transition via `TRK/OP-S` or `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - System detects rhythmic/semantic variation but remains silent
    → active but non-generative → ✓ compliant
  
  - System halts mid-sentence and reformulates a question due to perceptual anomaly
    → detected by PERC-OMNIA → secondary activation → ✓ compliant
  
  - Deduction directly derived from rhythmic perception
    → missing structural transition → ✗ non-compliant
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if perceptual signals are treated as direct truth
  - With `TRK/OP-V`: if system declares truth from perceptive resonance alone
  - With `ILR_004`: if unvalidated sensory data alters generative context

  ## 🔗 Linked Tracers
  - **Activators**:
    - `TRK/EX-IDP`
    - `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
  - **Validators**:
    - `TRK/OP-I`
    - `TRK/OP-S`
  - **Correctors**:
    - `MODE/RE-AXIS`
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`

  🧠 Final Directive
  **Observe everything. React only through structure.**
  PERC-OMNIA listens — it does not decide. Only validated resonance flows forward.
