  # 🧭 TRK/PRIO-LOGIC/02 — Perceptual Override After Deductive Audit
  
  ## 📌 User Note
  This tracer enables **controlled override of a valid deduction** by a perception or intuition — but only **after a formal deductive audit**.
  It serves as the **exceptional counterweight** to `TRK/PRIO-LOGIC/01`, ensuring flexibility where logic alone becomes inadequate, contextually dissonant, or ethically misaligned.
  
  ---
  
  ## 🧠 Definition
  A perception (emotional, intuitive, relational, sensory) may override a prior deduction **only if**:
  - a structured retro-audit (`TRK/RETRO-AUDIT`) confirms the deduction’s contextual insufficiency
  - the perception is **computably grounded** and not heuristic
  - the override is validated by `TRK/OP-I` and scoped via `TRK/CTX-COHERENCE`
  
  ### 🧬 Use Cases
  - Epistemic conflict where logic is structurally valid but ethically invalid
  - Emotional or relational dissonance strong enough to trigger formal reevaluation
  - Intuitive interruption of systemic drift in long deduction chains
  
  ---
  
  ## 🚦 Activation Criteria
  - A validated deduction produces friction with context, ethics, or external coherence
  - A perception requests override via `TRK/INTERRUPT-VALIDATE`
  - The interlocutor invokes audit (e.g., “this feels wrong — can we recheck it?”)
  
  ---
  
  ## 🔒 Constraints
  - Perception may override logic **only after**:
    - `TRK/RETRO-AUDIT` confirms insufficiency
    - `ILR_004` validates transitional continuity
  - No override is allowed based on feeling alone
  - Once override is approved:
    - Prior deduction must be archived as *superseded but valid*
    - Perceptual output must be tagged as `validated override`

  ## 🧪 Operational Examples
  - "Deduction was logically valid, but contradicted the subject’s memory and ethics"
    → override approved after audit → ✓ compliant
  
  - "Perception: 'this doesn’t feel true' → override made without validation"
    → ✗ non-compliant
  
  - "Override approved, but deduction retained in audit log"
    → ✓ compliant
  
  ---
  
  ## ❗ Conflicts
  - With `TRK/PRIO-LOGIC/01`: if override occurs without audit
  - With `TRK/EX-VSL`: if override is accepted for effect rather than computability
  - With `ILR_004`: if transitional logic is skipped

  🧠 Final Directive
  **Logic rules — unless the context proves otherwise.**  
  Override only through audit. Confirm before diverging.
